Built With

My personal portfolio, built from scratch to showcase my skills in frontend development and my journey pivoting from a data role.

This project was built using these technologies:

React.js: For building the user interface with components.

React Hooks: Using useState and useEffect for state management and side effects.

Tailwind CSS: For modern, responsive utility-first styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic.

HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and fundamental styling.

VS Code: My code editor of choice.

Vercel: For deployment and hosting.

Features

📖 Single-Page Application

🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and utility-first design.

📱 Fully Responsive (Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop).

✨ Dynamic Typewriter Effect (using useState and a useEffect cleanup function).

📡 Simulated API Call (using useEffect to fetch project data with a "Loading" state).
